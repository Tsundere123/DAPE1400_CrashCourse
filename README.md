## uwu, whats this?
A crash course I held for the OsloMet course DAPE1400 introduction to object oriented programming (Java)
Unfortunately the recordings weren't really useful, soz .-.

So instead I've spent the time to clean up the code, and instead cover what I did live in the lecture in the comments instead

##useful IntelliJ keybinds

I'll fix the Git/Github demo/explanation later

##How to use the demo / reading order
The classes have a _number ending
-Main_0
-MethodsAndVariables_1
-IfTests_2
-TryCatch_3
-etc

The number at the end denoes the order I covered them/suggest you read the demos

If you're taking the DAPE1400 exam: Good luck <3
If you're just some random passerby, I hope you have a great day :3
