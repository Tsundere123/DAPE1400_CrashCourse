## uwu, whats this?
A crash course I held for the OsloMet course DAPE1400 introduction to object oriented programming (Java) on the 23rd November 2023
Unfortunately the recordings weren't really useful, soz .-.

So instead I've spent the time to clean up the code, and instead cover what I did live in the lecture in the comments instead

## If you want to download this demo
Either

-click the green <> Code button, and download ZIP

-in Intellij, go to Git -> Clone and paste https://github.com/Tsundere123/DAPE1400_CrashCourse.git as the URL

-In the terminal git clone https://github.com/Tsundere123/DAPE1400_CrashCourse.git (Will clone to whatever folder/directory you are currently in!)

## useful IntelliJ keybinds

I'll fix the Git/Github demo/explanation later

## How to use the demo / reading order
The classes have a _number ending
-Main_0
-MethodsAndVariables_1
-IfTests_2
-TryCatch_3
-etc

I also covered 2 exam tasks
Continuation exam 2022, task 1 is in the root src folder
Continuation exam 2022, task 2 is in its own package com.konte22.task2

The number at the end denoes the order I covered them/suggest you read the demos

### Sidenote about the branches
There are a bunch of branches
These were used in the original lecture I held
They're not really useful without the original context, but if you want to see what I did live then its there

If you're taking the DAPE1400 exam: Good luck <3
If you're just some random passerby, I hope you have a great day :3

### I probably didn't use correct Java naming conventions and capitalisation
